## Instructions
Run the code.R file to execute function initializations and definitions.
makeGraph() function takes user input for number of nodes and edges and inputs all the edges one by one to make and return a graph.
runprogram(graph) function is to visualize the cascading behavior of a graph and return the cascading size, i.e., the number of nodes that have adopted the new behavior.
This function asks for user inputs for threshold values a (new behavior) and b (old behavior), shown in red and blue colors, respectively. Then it asks for seed nodes and then plots a comparison between the initial graph with marked seeds and the graph after cascading.
